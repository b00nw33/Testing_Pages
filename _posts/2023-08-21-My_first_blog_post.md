$$ x = y^2 $$

This sentence uses `$` delimiters to show math inline:  $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

Alternatively, you can use the ```math code block syntax to display a math expression as a block. With this syntax, you don't need to use $$ delimiters. The following will render the same as above:

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

```math
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
```
